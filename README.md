I’m a Software Engineer with a background in Computer Science, and I spend most of my time building things to see if they actually work.

Recently, that’s meant helping researchers use deep learning inside QGIS without needing ML expertise, and building Muscledia, a fitness app that uses game mechanics to make long-term consistency easier.

I enjoy the part of engineering where I have to go down the documentation wormhole.. usually the most frustrating part, but almost always the most fun for me.

I run Linux Mint, care a lot about security fundamentals (even if I don’t plan to specialize there), and try to use AI intentionally rather than by default, so my core programming skills stay sharp.
