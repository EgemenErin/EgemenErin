I'm an aspiring Data Analyst with a background in Computer Science, and I enjoy turning messy data into something that actually makes sense.

Recently, that's meant conducting geospatial analysis with QGIS and deep learning models to help researchers extract insights from satellite and aerial imagery, and building Muscledia, a fitness app where I used engagement metrics and user feedback to iteratively improve features and validate real outcomes (like a 40% increase in workout adherence).

I enjoy the part of analysis where I have to go down the documentation wormhole — usually the most frustrating part, but almost always the most rewarding. Whether it's wrangling data with Python and Pandas, building dashboards in Power BI, or writing SQL to find patterns others missed, I like work that connects data to decisions.

I run Linux Mint, care about reproducibility and clean workflows, and try to use AI intentionally rather than by default, so my core analytical skills stay sharp.
